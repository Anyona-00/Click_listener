       Good, bad, and stupid decisions are an inherent part of the human experience. Good decisions often lead to positive outcomes, fostering personal growth and well-being.
 They result from critical thinking, wisdom, and sound judgment. Bad decisions, on the other hand, can lead to undesirable consequences, causing setbacks or regrets.
 They often result from impulsivity, poor judgment, or inadequate information. Stupid decisions are those that, in hindsight, seem blatantly unwise or lacking common sense.
 They remind us of our fallibility and the importance of learning from our mistakes.
 Whether good, bad, or stupid, decisions play a crucial role in shaping our lives and providing opportunities for reflection and improvement.
